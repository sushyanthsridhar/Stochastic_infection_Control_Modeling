Modeling and Simulations
Mosquito Lifecycle Modeling
Lifecycle Stages: The simulation follows four key life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult mosquito.

Development and Mortality Rates:

Egg: Mortality (0.25–0.5), Development (0.4–0.6)
Larva: Mortality (0.3–0.5), Development (0.5–0.7)
Pupa: Mortality (0.1–0.2), Development (0.87–0.97)
Environmental Variables: Temperature, diurnal range, and larval density are integrated into the model to assess lifecycle dynamics.

Simulation Results
Duration: Simulations ran for 780 weeks.

Key Findings:

Total Eggs: 33,877
Total Larvae: 22,619
Total Pupae: 15,906
Total Adults: 14,643
Mortality Rate (Egg to Adult): 43%
Goals of the Study
Forecasting: Estimate mosquito populations by ovitrap to predict trends for the 2025-2026 season.

Optimization: Use non-linear stochastic models to predict infections, accounting for neighborhood clustering, elevation, and accessibility.

Resource Allocation: Develop a strategy for the placement of testing and treatment centers at optimal locations.

Performance Enhancement: Apply heuristics to minimize the optimality gap in the solutions obtained.
